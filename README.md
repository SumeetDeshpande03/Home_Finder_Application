-  XP Core Values:
    
   We have focussed on the following three core XP values
   -   Simplicity : As a team, we have refactored the code at each stage such that it is efficient, maintainable and easy to understand. Each team member has taken up the responsibility to refactor his own code to make it flexible for any future changes. We have used a minimalistic UI design and replicated it across all the main navigation pages.
   -   Feedback : We conducted weekly standups to discuss and demonstrate the progress of each member. Open feedback was constantly encouraged to identify any issues at their nascent stage itself. This helped us avoid any rework in the project at the later stage.
   -   Communication : We ensured that we communicated with the professor(product owner) for any clarification with the requirements of the project. Effective communication with the product owner as well as among team members helped ensure that everybody was on the same page at all times.
